Fort Funston,"&nbsp;Fort Funston has quite a lot to offer, whether it&rsquo;s striking 200-foot sandy bluffs, or the open space for your dogs to run free and wrestle around until its heart&rsquo;s content. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of heights or dogs, you can observe the gorgeous southwest coastline and the adventurous hang gliders leaping off it, from the safety of a wooden deck that is directly in front of the parking lot.Make sure to bring a jacket, the winds are almost constant here. Beginning on Skyline Road and walking up the narrow trail (there are a couple), you will be surrounded by sea figs. Once you get to the wider dirt path, and round the corner you will be greeted by beautiful cypress trees that, at times, make a shaded archway. Be sure to admire them for their own beauty, because when you round the corner and slowly make out the coastline, it will be hard to notice anything else. The height of the cliffs seem to amplify the splendor of the water. Glancing down at the shore, you will notice that many dogs and dog owners are enjoying that same landscape. From these cliffs, you can make it down to the beach. However, it is not wheelchair accessible and is rather steep.&nbsp;Continuing along the main path, you will see a couple of trivial run-off trails towards the cliffs. If you&rsquo;re the adventurous type, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to follow one. The private views they offer are as scary as they are stunning. Moving forward along the dirt path, you will eventually see a parking lot straight ahead, and the path will continue along the cliff. Here, there are also a couple of run-off paths that offer great views- just be careful to not get too close.&nbsp;Continuing on the main path will locate you in front of the wooden ramp and bridge that leads to one of the best look-out of the site, where you can view the stretching coastline, the sloping hillside with the houses upon it, and some adventurous hang gliders taking their chances with the wind. A very easy trail with lots of rewarding views.&nbsp;",37.7190316367472,-122.500637769699,Golden Gate National Recreation Area - San Francisco

Milagra Ridge,"Surrounded by urban development, Milagra Ridge forms what biologists call an island ecosystem. Here, wildlife is isolated from other habitats, feeding and migration corridors are compromised and exotic species can easily invade native habitat. Despite this isolation, Milagra Ridge hosts a surprising number of threatened and endangered species including Mission blue and San Bruno elfin butterflies and the California red-legged frog. Milagra&rsquo;s proximity to urban development, its limited size and its rare wildlife make it exceptionally sensitive to human disturbance. Therefore, visitors are required to stay on trails and pets must be leashed. More from NPS Great maps and info from",37.635572,-122.474332,Milagra Ridge - GGNRA

17th & Stanyan Trailhead,"Opened in 2011, this trailhead restores a long-lost access from Cole Valley neighborhood into Interior Greenbelt and Mt. Sutro Open Space Reserve. It&#39;s one of the most scenic approaches to Mt Sutro, and it&#39;s a short walk from MUNI N, 6, 37, and 43. &nbsp;The Historic Trail starts up a wooden stairway then turns up a narrow garden between two old houses, before entering a dense eucalyptus forest. Soon you join an old path and climb along Woodland Creek (audible after rain) then switchback across the upper slopes. &nbsp;The sheltered forest understory has marvelous songbirds early in the morning, and numerous native plants amidst the invasive ivy and blackberry.In about 0.4 mile is a junction with the Edgewood Trail.&nbsp;Here you can continue straight to follow the Historic Trail around the west flank of Mt. Sutro en route to the summit; or ascend sharp left on the Edgewood Trail to reach the Fairy Gates and North Ridge Trails, or descend right to Edgewood Ave.&nbsp;The grade is generally easy (10%), though about 100 yards into the woods is a brief, steep (20%) stretch that can be a bit of a challenge.The trail is multiuse, though bicyclists will need to dismount and carry their bikes on the Stanyan Street stairs.Learn more and find a detailed trail map at &nbsp;",37.7612707608,-122.452062964,Interior Green Belt

Benicia Bridge Bike Path North - Park Road,"The north end of the Benicia Bridge bike path starts at Park Road. The path starts under the freeway ramps, and soon runs alongside the southbound traffic. A spur trail branches right, under the bridge abutment to a rudimentary vista point and parking area. (The road to the vista point parallels the bike path, separated by a chain link fence). Once on the bridge you have great views west up Carquinez Strait toward Benicia and Martinez. Noisy but kinda scenic.&nbsp;The bike path was proposed as far back as 1989. It was dedicated in 2009 as the route of the Bay Area Ridge Trail and San Francisco Bay Trail. These two regional trails also coincide with a planned 50-mile Carquinez Strait Scenic Loop Trail linking to the Al Zampa Bridge between Vallejo and Crockett. More info at www.ridgetrail.org and www.baytrail.org.Park Road has not yet been dedicated by either trail organization, as it is a narrow road with narrow bike lanes. So far (2011) there is no sidewalk for pedestrians but traffic is relatively light and the bike lanes are walkable with care.&nbsp;Nearest transit stops are Benicia Breeze in downtown Benicia; and County Connection at the Martinez Amtrak station. These two transit agencies don&#39;t connect in Martinez but both have routes to Pleasant Hill BART. There&#39;s also an Amtrak bus stop in the industrial parks north of Benicia.",38.0502539516,-122.134537697,

Heading west and uphill from the trail is a levee trail that separates Sharp Park Golf Course from the ocean. To the south another .5 miles is Pacifica Pier. Although this route requires careful navigation around lots of ruts and is quite bumpy, the sweeping views are worth the effort. If you combine the hilly portions, the level section and the coastal levee trail you could hike for a few miles.For a longer hike, you could connect via a sidewalk along Hwy 1 a short distance, to Calera Creek Trail.

Quarry Lakes by BART,"Parts of hike published in the July 2008 issue of Bay Nature magazineIt&#39;s a shame that going hiking or swimming so often entails firing up the old greenhouse gas generator. But thanks to its proximity to BART, Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area in Fremont provides an opportunity to enjoy the outdoors without enlarging your carbon footprint. With easy trails, plentiful wildlife, and a swimming area, this is also a fun outing for kids.&nbsp;To get there from the Union City BART station, exit onto Union Square St. and go left (south) to Alvarado Niles Road; left again two blocks, past Osprey Drive to the locked gate that excludes cars from Fox Avenue, a weed grown but smooth asphalt track to the park. There&#39;s a pedestrian entrance, and once past it, you&#39;re screened by feral pines, eucalyptus and coyote brush from nearby traffic and the BART tracks, passing an undeveloped hay field active with meadowlarks and song sparrows. This backdoor entrance enters the park behind its parking lot, becoming Western Pacific Trail (gravel, and not entirely smooth) after 0.5 mile as it passes the swim beach and its fully accessible restrooms. From there to the &quot;Natural Unit&quot; near Alameda Creek, where volunteers have planted wildlife friendly vegetation and constructed nest boxes and platforms, is another half-mile along the shore of Horseshoe Lake. It&#39;s possible to make a three-mile loop around the lakes, on generally medium smooth gravel, or extend your expedition to take in as much as you wish of the 12 mile trail along Alameda Creek.Most of the park&#39;s 539 acres are open water, six lakes born in the eponymous gravel quarries and now reshaped for recreation and habitat. Much of the rest is parking lot and lawn, but near Lago Los Osos and Willow Slough, wild-flowers bloom and plantings both native and exotic create an interesting if raggedy green environment. The small trees give little shade, but folks see deer and jackrabbits frequently, and the lakes are stocked with trout and catfish for the benefit of anglers, also attracting cormorants, terns, and white pelicans, so the birdwatching can be choice. Near the main entrance, there is a rather grand ramp to a fishing pier for wheelchair users, and a swimming area that is open every day in summer and weekends in spring and fall.Getting there: BART to Union City. By car from I-880, take Decoto Road east, right on Paseo Padre, left on Isherwood; entrance on right. Fees for parking, dogs, swimming, fishing.",37.5913493434,-122.018043995,

Oat Hill Mine Trail," One of the best hidden hikes in the Bay Area! See below for description and history from napaoutdoors.org With the discovery of cinnabar deposits in the late 1800’s Napa County saw the development of several mines to extract the ore and produce quicksilver (mercury).  The most    productive of several mines in the area was the Oat Hill Mine which accounted for one third of the total U.S.   production of quicksilver from its discovery in 1872 until the late 1960’s.  The mine was idle from 1923 to 1927 when it reopened and operated continuously through 1944.  After the Second World War mining profits fell, and mining ceased in the late 1960’s.   Construction of the Oat Hill Mine Road was started in 1873 to provide a transportation route between Calistoga and the mines.  It took 20 years to complete the project and the road was officially opened in 1893.  The road connected Calistoga to the Oat Hill Mine with a side branch descending to Aetna Springs.   Today the 8.3 mile long Oat Hill Mine Trail follows the original route between Calistoga and the western end of Aetna Springs Road in Pope Valley.  The old mercury mines are further to the north, and are not open to the public. The trail provides a magnificent  recreational experience for hikers, mountain bicyclists and equestrians, although the trail is rough and rocky in many places, and can be quite challenging  Visitors enjoy sweeping views of Napa Valley along the lower Oat Hill Mine Trail, while the middle and upper sections of the trail cross striking   volcanic formations.  The trail passes through a diverse mixture of Oak, Douglas Fir, Gray Pine and Cypress forests, chaparral, and grasslands.  Spring wildflowers are exceptional.   Midway along the trail is the homestead property of Karl Gustov Holm, who built a log cabin on his 160 acre homestead in 1893, and added a new house in 1896.  Parts of stone wall for his barn and a few old fruit trees remain today.   Ruts carved by heavy wagons traversing the soft       volcanic rock are still visible along parts of the middle and upper trail.  Hand-laid stone walls are visible at many locations along the trail.",38.5893516792544,-122.577422708273,
