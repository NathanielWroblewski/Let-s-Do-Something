Wiltern Theatre,3790 Wilshire Boulevard,Los Angeles,CA,90010,213-388-1400,"Owner description: The Wiltern Theatre first opened its doors to movie crowds on October 7th, 1931. Recognized by the City of Los Angeles as a Historic Cultural Monument, this Art Deco Landmark was renovated and restored to its original splendor in 1985, under the direction of Bill Graham Presents. Following a legendary history of performances and events, a $1.5 million facelift led to the Grand Re-Opening on October 15, 2002. Formerly an all-seated venue, the theatre had its 1,200-orchestra seats removed and now features a five-tiered floor that slants upward from the stage, thereby accommodating a standing-room-only configuration. The balcony still offers a thousand seats, and the flexible new arrangement allows for seats to be brought in for more intimate performances. The venue's new capacity is roughly 2,300, depending on how the floor is set up. In October 2003, The Wiltern and LG Electronics, a leading global consumer electronics company, celebrated the renaming of the theater. Currently known as The Wiltern LG, this venue sponsorship will offer concert-goers the opportunity to become acquainted with LG Electronics' line of well-designed, groundbreaking digital products. Formerly a great place to catch more sedate acts, the Wiltern's new design makes it one of “LA's coolest venues to check out performers of any type of music” says AOL’s City Guide.

The original stone structure is now joined by The Hess Art Collection, a world-class showcase of contemporary art that captures “two passions under one roof.” The Hess Collection uses sustainable, environmentally-sound practices with the axiom, “Nurture the land, and return what you take.” That philosophy brings with it a dedication to delivering wines that speak to their natural origins.

Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center,10 10th Street,Oakland,CA,94607,Update attraction details,"Owner description: Located across from Laney College near Lake Merritt and the Estuary at 10 10th St Oakland, CA 94607 the Oakland Municipal Auditorium (a.k.a. The Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center) includes the 1,900 seat formal Calvin Simmons Theater, and a multi-purpose arena, which seats up to 4,500 people. The Oakland Municipal Auditorium was opened in 1914 has been used for everything from the provision of emergency medical services in the Flu pandemic of 1918, to Grateful Dead and Oakland Ballet performances to the Black Panther Party Black Community Survival Conference and the Green Party Presidential Campaign of Ralph Nader.Mayor Jerry Brown closed the auditorium in 2006, allegedly because of a slight operating deficit, but more likely in an attempt to set up the sale of the property in the booming real estate market of the time. The Convention Center was one of the few large venues staffed by Union workers and many labor unions and left political groups used the hall because it paid the workers decent wages. When Brown closed the hall 20 workers lost good paying union jobs and the community lost a locale for everything from high school graduations to AC/DC concerts. The supposed annual budget savings were $300,000 a year. (City staff recently estimated that in the intervening five years $5,000,000 to $9,000,000 worth of decay had occurred in the property. ) Jobs, public service and economic stimulus of a vital downtown jewel were destroyed due to property speculation. (Even the Citty’s 1% were hurt—the Oakland Ballet which used the Calvin Simmons Theater in the Center became homeless and went out of business for over a year.) The property has been left largely vacant, except for some isolated event rentals since then. In 2011, in a paperwork shuffle the City of Oakland sold the property to its the Redevelopment agency (the City Council is the board of the Redevelopment Agency). « less  Paramount Theatre Oakland Museum of California Oakland Zoo Fairyland East Bay Regional Park District Mountain View Cemetery The Cathedral of Christ the Light Lake Merritt Grand Lake Theater Chabot Space & Science Center USS Potomac Mazzariello Labyrinth: Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve Woodminster Amphitheater Jack London Square Chinatown Dunsmuir House Oracle Arena Jack London's Cabin Lakeside Park and Garden Center Old Oakland",http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32810-d1419402-Reviews-Henry_J_Kaiser_Convention_Center-Oakland_California.html
